#0x14. C - Bit manipulation
##The header file `main.h` contains declarations for the following functions:

1. `unsigned int binary_to_uint(const char *b)` - a function that converts a binary number to an unsigned integer.
2. `void print_binary(unsigned long int n)` - a function that prints the binary representation of an unsigned long integer.
3. `int _putchar(char c)` - a function that writes a character to stdout.
4. `int get_bit(unsigned long int n, unsigned int index)` - a function that returns the value of a bit at a given index.
5. `int set_bit(unsigned long int *n, unsigned int index)` - a function that sets the value of a bit at a given index to 1.
6. `int clear_bit(unsigned long int *n, unsigned int index)` - a function that sets the value of a bit at a given index to 0.
7. `unsigned int flip_bits(unsigned long int n, unsigned long int m)` - a function that returns the number of bits that need to be flipped to convert one number to another.
8. `int get_endianness(void)` - a function that checks the endianness of the computer.
